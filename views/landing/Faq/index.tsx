        <Accordion title="What is the TIDAL token ?">
          TIDAL is a token that is designed to generate high-yield rewards for
          you, by combining more than 30 different DeFi yield protocols.
          <br />
          <br />
          This means that you will be able to take advantage of a large variety
          of yield-generating protocols, without having to find the best ones
          yourself and conduct due-diligence, and without having to pay for the
          fees of each platform.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="How to get TIDAL lifetime rewards ?">
          TIDAL uses a simple yet innovative mechanism to redistribute the yield
          while supporting the growth of the token: the TIDAL-nodes.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can create a TIDAL-node with 10 TIDAL tokens. Once your node is
          created, it canâ€™t be undone and it generates lifetime returns in TIDAL
          tokens for you.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="What happens to the 10 TIDAL used to create a node ?">
          When a TIDAL-node is created, 10 TIDAL are transferred to the rewards
          pool, 1 TIDAL is added to the liquidity pool as 50% TIDAL and 50% BNB,
          and 2 TIDAL are transferred to the marketing/team wallet to work on
          the stabilization of the whole protocol, and the token growth.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Which DeFi yield protocols are currently used by TIDAL ?">
          TIDAL has just been launched (this means that you are still very
          early) so our current focus is to work on the
          <AccordionColorText> stability and growth of </AccordionColorText>
          TIDAL, leveraging its powerful tokenomics designed for steady growth.
          <br />
          <br />
          The next step of our roadmap is to begin navigating between different
          DeFi yield protocols. That being said, you can receive very high
          lifetime returns by creating TIDAL-nodes.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Why is TIDAL on the Binance Smart Chain?">
          Our goal is to bring DeFi into the average household. Ethereum's high
          gas fees make it impossible for most people to access the Ethereum
          network.
          <br />
          <br />
          We want TIDAL to be
          <AccordionColorText> accessible to everyone </AccordionColorText>,
          including smallholders, so we chose to be on the Binance Smart Chain.
          However, this does not prevent us from taking advantage of DeFi yield
          protocols on Ethereum.
